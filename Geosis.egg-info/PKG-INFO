<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The geography of knowledge production represents the method by which local scientific output are accepted, produced and debated elsewhere. However, in order to analyze geographic data, one must look for trends, networks, evolutions and relationships. However, while open source and free software started attracting academic from various disciplines, several handicaps persist such as (i) synthesizing the bottom-up knowledge production, (ii) inspect the genealogy of a given field, (iii) displaying the spatial distribution of the field across territories, and (iv) unpacking the spatial community network structure. Geosis is an artificial intelligence-based package developed to reply to such questions in a fast and easily process using large-scale textual data. The input data goes into three main data preprocessing stages. The first is a geoparsing module where the textual data became geo-referenced. The second is a natural language processing (NLP) module where data is synthesized and major themes are extracted. The third is network analysis module where research community on the field is mapped and major field producers are unveiled.  To our knowledge, our package is considered to be the first package that can unpack all the aspects of “knowledge production” for any given field.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] Collect data from Scopus or Web of Science (WoS)
- [x] Read the data using Geosis' local functions 
- [ ] Add Additional Templates w/ Examples
- [ ] Add "components" document to easily copy & paste sections of the readme
- [x] Multi-language Support
    - [x] English
    - [ ] French
    - [ ] Chinese
    - [ ] Spanish

See the [open issues](https://github.com/mohamed-hachaichi/Geosis/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

The python package is accessible from PyPI following the link: . Note that the package will be maintained, and new releases will be available in the future expanding its geographical analysis scope and providing much more capabilities and mapping options. Geosis is built on: Pandas, GeoPandas, and NetworkX.
